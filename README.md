# Object-detection-using-yolov2
First task of 1 month internship under the Sparks foundation 

About project----->
This project is about to detect the objects in the inputed image ,the detection algorithm which i used is yolo version 2 but there are several other ways too 
for example mobilenet,SSD, R-CNN and the further available versions of yolo.

Yolo is YOU ONLY look ONCE algorithm.

Things to be used for implementing --->
1)   Yolov2 weights are the pretrained model weights for Yolov2 available in the darknet directory.
2)   coco.names is the list of all the objects which the model can predict in the image, the model cannot predict the things which are not included in thi list 
3)   The images you want to predict the objects in should also be in the same directory while working in google colab.
4)   Yolov2.cfg

I have attached the drive link of the yolov2 weights in the main as it cannot be attached here because of it's size 
Google colab link has also been attached in the same folder


Thank you!
